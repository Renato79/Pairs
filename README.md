Pairs is a classic game that I created to demostrate my skills in pure, clean and simple (vanilla) JavaScript.

The game presents a main page with the board game, and three links: How to play, Solution (To see the solution of the current game) and New Game.

The score is based on a timer, then you can improve your score at any time you play again.
