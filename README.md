<h1 align="center">Pairs - Memory Game</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://renato79.github.io/Pairs/)

Pairs is a classic game that I created to demostrate my skills in pure, clean and simple (Vanilla) JavaScript.

The game presents a main page with the board game, and three links: How to play, Solution (To see the solution of the current game) and New Game. The score is based on a timer, then you can improve your score at any time you play again.
